  "synopsis": "The Shingeki no Kyojin  is about the the animanga series 'Shingeki no Kyojin' (commonly known as 'Attack on Titan' Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titan. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind. Nominated for the 4th Manga Taisho Awards (2011) and won the Kodansha Manga Award shōnen category (2011). In English the series is roughly translated to 'Attack on Titan'.",

Eren Jaeger, of the town called the Shiganshina District, wishes to see the outside world by joining the Scout Regiment, as he likens living in the cities to livestock. Despite this, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackermann and their mother Carla Jaeger are against him joining the Scouts. Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties, Eren expresses his interest to join, which impresses his father Grisha Jaeger, who promises to show him what lies in their basement once he returns. After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlert from a group of delinquents, the Colossal Titan, a 60m Titan, suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to the Shiganshina District, which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria, allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the town erupts into mass panic, Eren and Mikasa rush back to their house, only to see Carla pinned under their collapsed house. As a Smiling Titan approaches them, Carla begs them to flee, but they refuse until city guard Hannes arrives and assures them that he will defend them. However, as he charges towards the Titan, he is overcome with fear and takes Eren and Mikasa away. Eren watches in horror as a Smiling Titan eats Carla.",

Some of townsfolk of the Shiganshina District escape to the inner Wall Maria, while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. The soldiers try to close the gate, but the Armored Titan rams the gate, breaching the inner Wall Maria, and causing those inside to retreat even further inside Wall Rose. Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter do not like sharing their food or homes with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to either work on the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria. About 250,000 people, 20% of the populace, choose to fight, only to be wiped out by the Titans. Eren vows revenge and joins the army along with Mikasa and Armin.",

He reaches for Armin with his left arm out of the Bearded Titan's mouth, but the Bearded Titan closes its jaws, severing Eren's arm and swallowing him.",

Mikasa and Conny agree with his plan and defeat the Titans attacking it, before rushing to the supply depot. Meanwhile, Jean and the others reach the supply depot despite suffering more casualties on the way, with Armin, Mikasa and Conny arriving soon after. Armin's plan works, but while the mysterious Titan is able to attract the enemies outside, seven smaller Titans remain in the fuel storage area. With their equipment out of fuel, Armin devises another plan. The survivors draw the Titans' attention to an elevator and shoot them in the eyes to blind them, while seven of them jump from the ceiling to finish them off. Sasha and Conny fail to kill their targets but are saved by Mikasa and Annie. Having successfully replenished their fuel, the soldiers prepare to retreat. As they see the mysterious Titan defeating all of the other Titans before collapsing, they are shocked to watch Eren emerge from its body. Mikasa reaches Eren and cries upon confirming that he is alive, while Armin notices that Eren's severed leg and arm have somehow regenerated as well.",

When Eren was eaten and swallowed by the Bearded Titan, he found himself in its stomach along with the bodies of its victims. His rage at the Titans caused him to burst out of the Bearded Titan's stomach by transforming himself into the mysterious Titan and going on a rampage against them. Although Eren's comrades saw him emerge from the mysterious Titan, they all agreed to keep it a secret and bring him back inside Wall Rose. However, Kitts also witnessed this and has his men aim their weapons at Eren. Armin and Mikasa try to defend Eren, but to no avail. As Kitts fearfully orders the cannons to fire on the three of them, Eren recalls hazy memories of his father giving him an injection, telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home's basement with his key. In order to protect Mikasa and Armin from the cannons, Eren partially transforms himself into a Titan, sheltering them inside his ribs.",

He believes that it holds the secret to mankind's preservation and the key to destroying the Titans. Kitts once again orders the cannon to be loaded out of fear. Eren comes up with two plans of escape. The first is for Eren to retreat as a Titan and criminalize himself in the eyes of humanity, and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that Eren is an asset rather than a danger. Armin comes to the conclusion that he can still defend his friends despite his cowardice, deciding to try and talk their way out of being executed. Armin tentatively convinces Kitts, only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more. The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene, sparing their lives. In return, Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in.

After Armin's squad manages to kill an Abnormal Titan, a Female Titan suddenly appears from the right flank at high speed. Much to Armin's shock, the Female Titan's body withstands their blades and is intelligent enough to kill his seniors easily. The Female Titan captures Armin, but after removing his hood and seeing his face, she leaves him alive and continues running. Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean, who reveals that their right flank was wiped out by the Titans. Armin then realizes that the Female Titan is possibly another intelligent Titan like Eren. When the three of them give conflicting locations for where Eren is in the formation, they realize the Female Titan's target is Eren and that they must stop her. Avoiding their failed attempts to attack, she leaves them and heads towards the center group.",

Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.For centuries, humanity has been hunted by giant, mysterious predators known as the Titans.

Meanwhile, Erwin Smith is informed that Wall Rose was breached and Titans are roaming inside. Twelve hours earlier, the rest of the 104th Cadets are stationed at an outpost when Titans are seen advancing from the south. Miche Zacharius orders the soldiers and cadets to spread out and inform the nearby villages and the capital about the Titans while he stays behind to delay them.  Miche buys enough time and prepares to escape, but is captured by a Beast Titan, which is apelike in appearance and capable of speaking. Miche hesitates to respond when the Beast Titan inquires about his omni-directional mobility gear, so the Beast Titan strips Miche of his omni-directional mobility gear and leaves him to be eaten by the other Titans.",

Meanwhile, Sasha Braus rushes to Dauper in order to warn her father and the villagers.

Sasha takes the girl and flees, but they are chased by the Titan. Deciding to stay and fight while urging the girl to run away, Sasha succeeds in blinding the Titan with her arrows just as a group of villagers, including her father and the girl, return to pick her up. Meanwhile, Conny Springer and his group arrive at Ragako, only to find that it had already been attacked by Titans. Upon reaching his house, Conny discovers a Titan on its back trapped inside, and he wonders how it was able to travel so far from the walls since its legs seem too feeble to support its body.",

Elsewhere, Christa Lenz tells Ymir not to worry about her when the latter asks Nanaba and Henning to allow the two to leave their group. Both groups eventually meet up at nighttime, discovering that no breaches occurred at the walls and deciding to rest up at Castle Utgard. Meanwhile, Eren Jaeger learns from Hange he could learn how to seal the breach in the Shiganshina District, seeing as the crystallized skin from Annie Leonhart as the Female Titan is the same material from the walls. Pastor Nick eventually reveals to Hange that Christa is the key to finding all the answers. Soon after, Sasha arrives and hands Hange a scroll from Erwin, advising Hange and the Scouts to head to Castle Utgard. In the meantime, the Beast Titan leads the other Titans to attack Castle Utgard.

Conny mentions that the Titan he encountered at Ragako resembled his mother, but Ymir plays it off. Reiner Braun becomes suspicious when Ymir is able to read the unknown language on a food can labeled herring. The Titans soon appear, and the senior soldiers hold them off from the outside while the 104th Cadets defend themselves against smaller Titans that have breached the castle. In the process, Reiner has his arm badly injured after it is bitten by a Titan. After clearing the area of Titans, the Beast Titan throws chunks of Wall Rose at the castle, killing the group's horses. A second wave of Titans subsequently attack the castle, and the senior soldiers are soon overwhelmed and killed.

Ymir accused Christa of having a death wish rather than saving Daz for selfless reasons. She was also aware that Christa is an unwanted illegitimate daughter of a nobleman's mistress who was forced by the Wall Cult to change her name and join the army. Ymir then made Christa promise that she must live her own life if she ever reveals her true name. Back in the present, Ymir transforms into a small, nimble intelligent Titan and fights off the other Titans. Christa tells Ymir to destroy the tower in order to crush the Titans. As the tower begins to collapse, Ymir orders Christa and the others to grab on to her. Despite this effort, the Titans overwhelm Ymir, but Hange and the other Scouts arrive on time to save the 104th Cadets. With the battle over, Christa attends a gravely injured Ymir as the rest of the 104th Cadets learn that Ymir is an intelligent Titan. Just before Ymir loses consciousness, Christa reveals that her real name is Historia Reiss.",

Reiner explains that the mission to destroy all of humanity can be avoided if Eren would simply join them. Twelve hours earlier in the Ehrmich District, Hange explained that the scroll received from Sasha contained a background report on Annie, suggesting a connection with Reiner and Bertholdt, as all three are from the same area but otherwise have little information available. The Scouts eventually realized that they may have helped Annie find Eren's location within the formation during the 57th Expedition. Therefore, Hange ordered the others to keep an eye on Reiner and Bertholdt without raising undue suspicion. Back in the present, Reiner and Bertholdt both shift into their Titan forms, despite a quick intervention by Mikasa Ackermann. The Armored Titan grabs Eren and slides down the wall as the Colossal Titan grabs Ymir. Feeling betrayed, Eren shifts into a Titan and begins to fight the Armored Titan.",

The Armored Titan gains the upper hand in his fight against Eren, and the situation seems desperate even with assistance from Mikasa.

Meanwhile, in the Forest of Giant Trees, as Eren and Ymir continue to regenerate their limbs, Ymir points out that not only are they surrounded by Titans, but also Reiner and Bertholdt stole their omni-directional mobility gear. Reiner and Bertholdt plan to take Eren and Ymir to their hometown, but are waiting until nightfall when the surrounding Titans cannot move. Eren is reminded by Ymir that they are in no position to fight or flee until they regenerate. Reiner begins to ramble about his duty as a soldier and as a warrior, which Ymir deduces that there is confusion between his undercover and real personas. Ymir is highly concerned about the Beast Titan, who caused the recent Titan invasion and may be their real enemy. Reiner then uses Ymir's concern for Historia's safety as leverage to drive a wedge between Eren and Ymir. The discussion is interrupted by the sound of flare guns, signalling the arrival of the Scouts.",

At the Forest of Giant Trees, after Eren is restrained, Ymir says that Reiner and Bertholdt must take Historia with them. In a flashback, Ymir was worshiped by a cult as a child under supposed royalty. The cult was later apprehended and punished by soldiers, in which Ymir was injected with something and thrown off a wall, resulting in her transforming into a Pure Titan. Ymir spent the next sixty years as a Titan until she ate Marcel, a childhood friend of Reiner, Bertholdt and Annie, which returned her to human form. She realized that her freedom of accepting her true identity was why she developed such empathy with Historia. In the present, Ymir convinces Reiner and Bertholdt to allow her to transform into her Titan form and take Historia with them. When the Scouts enter the forest, Ymir finds and swallows Historia before rejoining Reiner and Bertholdt. Reiner transforms as the Armored Titan, while Bertholdt, Eren and Ymir climb on its shoulders, as they flee at the edge of the forest with the Scouts in hot pursuit.",

Hange reports that Pastor Nick has been tortured and murdered in the Trost District barracks but she accuses the Military Police's First Interior Squad of being responsible. Levi suspects that someone in the government has their sights set on destroying the Survey Corps and concealing the secrets of the Titans. After Nifa delivers a message from Erwin, who has been arrested by the Military Police, Levi has the Scouts abandon their hideout only shortly before the Military Police arrives to raid it. Levi figures that the government is after Eren and Historia, and he decides to head back to the Trost District. Before Hange leaves with Moblit to go after Erwin, Eren gives her a written copy of the conversation he recalled between Ymir and Bertholdt. The Scouts arrive secretly back in Trost, and Jean and Armin - disguised as decoys for Eren and Historia - are soon abducted by Dimo Reeves, who was hired by the Interior Police, but Mikasa and the others easily rescue them and capture their kidnappers. Meanwhile, Levi shadows Eren and Historia's transport from rooftops with Nifa and two other soldiers from Hange's Fourth Squad. He instinctively feels uneasy and tells Nifa about Kenny the Ripper, a notorious serial killer he knew in the past, when suddenly Kenny and his henchmen appear and ambush them with slug guns, killing Nifa and the rest of her team before confronting Levi.",

Just as Erwin is sentenced to death, news arrives that Wall Rose has been breached by Titans. However, rather than allow Wall Rose refugees shelter within Wall Sina, the council orders the gates closed, sacrificing the entire Wall Rose population. A disgusted Nile refuses to obey the order, and Chancellor Darius Zackly arrives with his troops, revealing the news of the breach was a ruse. With the council's self-interest and disregard for human life now revealed, Pyxis announces the Military will take over the government and publish the news in the press. Later, the remaining scouts receive the news, and Hange tells the others about the mysterious deaths of Rod Reiss' family at their Chapel. Meanwhile, in a crystalline cavern, a chain-bound Eren is approached by Historia.",

Rod then instructs Historia to touch Eren, triggering subconscious memories which leave Eren traumatized from learning that he was turned into a Titan by his father Grisha and ate his father on the night he received the basement key. The process also unintentionally triggers Historia's memories of a young woman named Frieda, whom Rod reveals to be Historia's half-sister, who erased herself from Historia's memories. Rod explains that Frieda possessed the Founding Titan power inherited in their family, before Grisha, who was also a Titan Shifter, devoured her for it while slaughtering her four siblings and mother. Later, Kenny arrives and updates them on the coup before preparing to defend the crystalline cavern beneath the Reiss chapel with his men. Meanwhile in the capital, Pyxis reveals to Erwin that the Reiss family possess the power to alter people's memories, and Erwin leads a force out to rescue Eren. As Kenny Ackerman prepares his defense, he recalls his grandfather saying that the Ackermans were once bodyguards to the Reiss royal family but were exiled as the Reiss memory altering powers had no effect on them. Meanwhile, Squad Levi finds a hidden trapdoor in the floor of the Reiss chapel, and they prepare to descend and rescue Eren.",

Meanwhile, Rod explains to Historia that the cavern and city walls were built a century ago by their ancestor, who used the Founding Titan's power to erase the memories of all citizens except a few immune bloodlines. Generations later, Frieda inherited the Founding Titan and the memories of their world before the walls. Rod explains that Frieda metaphysically lives on within the Founding Titan, with Historia realizing that she must become a Titan and eat Eren to gain the Founding Titan and see her sister again. When Kenny arrives and overhears that only those of the Reiss bloodline can use the Founding Titan's power, he furiously confronts Rod and decides to wound Eren so Historia will have to fight Eren to acquire the power. Historia is about to inject herself with the Titan serum when she sees Eren is too guilt-ridden to resist. She then remembers Ymir's wish for her to live a prideful life, and realizes that Rod's true intent is restoring his family's power, and the will of her ancestors to preserve the status quo will consume her like it did with Frieda and those before her. Historia then angrily refuses to proceed, breaking the syringe and slamming her father into the ground breaking his back, before grabbing the keys to free Eren. Desperate, Rod licks up some of the serum from the broken syringe on the ground and transforms into a massive Titan.",

The Scouts retrieve Eren from his crystallized Titan body and head back towards the Orvud District at Wall Sina.

Erwin's plan works initially, as they manage to get Rod's titan close to the wall where the trap is set. However, the Garrison Corp's cannon barrages have little effect, and Rod's Titan eventually reaches and towers against the wall. As its face and chest have eroded from crawling for miles on the ground, the Scouts then implement their own plan. They first ram the Titan's supporting arms with gunpowder-loaded carts and destroy them with the ensuing explosion. After the Titan falls face-first onto the top of the wall, Eren assumes his Titan form and plunges a bundle of gunpowder barrels into its gaping mouth. After the Titan's nape is blown from within, the Scouts then quickly mop up the airborne fragments with their 3D Maneuver gears. Historia succeeds in destroying the main fragments holding Rod, killing her father and seeing some of his memories, before falling into a cushioned wagon below in the city street in front of astonished residents. She recovers from her fall and formally introduces herself to the gathered civilians as the true ruler of the walls. Back at the Reiss estate, a mortally wounded Kenny recalls events in his past before being found by Levi.",

        "description": "The Survey Corps treks through the forest under the darkness of a new moon, planning to retake the Shiganshina District in order to reach Eren's basement. On the way, they see a sleeping titan but manage to pass by without waking it up. The group arrives at the seemingly empty Shiganshina District and Eren easily blocks the hole in the outer wall with his titan hardening ability. Before Eren plugs the hole in the inner wall, Armin discovers a recently abandoned campsite and is given command to search for enemies planning an ambush. Armin assigns members of the Survey Corps to search for cavities within the walls and before long, Reiner bursts from a disguised hole in the wall and transforms into the Armored Titan. Suddenly, the Corps find themselves surrounded by Titans and the Beast Titan seals the inner entrance with a thrown boulder, trapping the horses within Shiganshina and preventing the Corps from using them to escape.",

        "description": "Reiner, as the Armored Titan, initially begins climbing up the wall towards the Survey Corps when the Beast Titan gives a signal and the 2-3 meter Titans within Wall Maria rush towards the wall, targeting the horses to cut off the escape route of the Survey Corps. Three squads are sent to protect the horses, while the Levi and Hange squads prepare to tackle the Armored Titan utilizing Thunder Spears. Erwin initially keeps Levi and Armin back, to target the Beast Titan. Meanwhile, the Armored Titan reaches the top of the wall and encounters Erwin waiting for it, but suddenly Eren transforms into his Titan form and flees. The Armored Titan takes the bait, abandoning its target of the horses, and chases Eren. They engage in a battle of force and wits as each tries to gain the upper hand, but Eren's training of hardening his hands pays off as he temporarily weakens the Armored Titan. Hange and her squad then attack it with Thunder Spears, aiming for the nape of the neck. Their initial attack weakens the Titan, so they follow up with a barrage of the spears in an attempt to finally destroy the Armored Titan along with Reiner.",

Bertholdt then recalls himself and Reiner meeting with War Chief Zeke in Shiganshina some time before the Survey Corps arrive, with Reiner criticizing his friend's lack of commitment. Back in the present, the Armored Titan lets out a roar, signalling the Beast Titan to throw a barrel containing Bertholdt into Shiganshina. Seeing Reiner down, hoping his friend can hear him, Bertholdt does not immediately transform and instead confronts the Scouts. Armin attempts to negotiate with him, but Bertholdt reveals to have found his resolution and intends to kill everyone before swinging himself high into the sky to transform into the Colossal Titan, creating a massive fiery explosion. With the fate of Hange and her group ambiguous, Armin hesitates over attempting an attack or retreat as the Colossal Titan begins to advance towards the inner wall.",

Armin is frozen by indecision, handing command over to Jean as they head for the river and stay hidden. Outside the wall, the Beast Titan pitches a barrage of stones towards the scouts holding the horses outside the wall, shredding buildings and causing casualties among them. Levi has the remainder regroup with Erwin at the Wall's base. Back in Shiganshina, Eren vainly tries to stop the Colossal Titan by grabbing its foot, only to be knocked unconscious when kicked onto the wall. Jean orders Armin's team to attack with Thunder Spears, but the Colossal Titan deflects them with a huge burst of steam. The situation looks hopeless before Erwin suggests a counter-attack with himself and the remaining recruits as a sacrificial diversion so Levi can kill the Beast Titan, knowing that he would likely die without ever learning the truth concealed in the basement of Eren's house. Erwin gives a rousing speech to the recruits, convincing them that it is better to die fighting than be killed while hiding from flying rocks, and leads the charge towards the Beast Titan through a hail of rocks.",

Levi manages to incapacitate the Beast Titan and rips Zeke out after inflicting enough injuries to keep him from resuming his Titan form, intending to turn one of the casualties into a Titan to feed the war chief to. But the Cart Titan snatches Zeke in its mouth and runs off, Zeke admitting to underestimate Levi while ordering the remaining Titans to attack him. Meanwhile, Armin realizes the Colossal Titan is immobile while using its steam and gives Eren some detail of his plan while the others hold off a somewhat confused Armored Titan, Reiner having lost his most recent memories due to the last attack. The group, joined by Hange who survived Bertholt's transformation, use two of their remaining thunder spears to shatter the Armored Titan's jaw hinges so Mikasa can use hers to blow Reiner out of his Titan body. When Eren's Titan form seems to be suffering a concussion, Armin deliberately challenges the Colossal Titan by having his ODM gear hook into the monster's tooth. Bertholt proceeds to burn Armin alive in his steam, learning too late that Armin used himself as a distraction so Eren can harden his Titan form and, in human form, covertly maneuver himself into position to rip Bertholdt out of the Colossal Titan. In the aftermath, Eren drags the limbless Bertholt towards the severely burnt Armin whom Eren recalls has always been braver than he appears.",

His reverie is interrupted by the Cart Titan carrying Zeke, who asserts that Eren was lied to by his father. Zeke departs when Levi arrives, still in pursuit, promising to return and save Eren. Elsewhere, after Reiner hands her a letter from Ymir, Hange was about to kill him before convinced by Jean to have Mikasa fetch the Titan serum from Levi so they can transfer the Armored Titan power to one of their own. But as the Cart Titan rescues Reiner, Mikasa learns from Eren that Armin is still alive as Levi prepares to inject him with the serum. But Floch Forster, the only surviving recruit from the suicide charge, arrives with the mortally wounded Erwin. This causes Levi to consider Erwin instead, causing Eren and Mikasa to openly defy that decision with the latter attacking Levi until being restrained by Hange. Once everyone calms down, Levi orders everyone to leave and prepares to inject Erwin. But Erwin withdraws his arm in delirium, causing Levi to recall his conversation with Erwin before the suicide charge and ultimately chooses to let the commander rest in peace and give the serum to Armin instead. As Erwin succumbs, Armin becomes a mindless Titan and eats Bertholdt. Levi and Hange mourn the deceased Erwin while the rest of the squad share an emotional moment as Armin emerges healed from his Titan form.",

However, they are caught by two Public Safety soldiers. Not wanting to trouble his parents, Grisha took a beating for himself and Fay by Kruger while his partner Gross offers to take Fay home. But Fay's bloodied corpse is found the next day with Grisha knowing Gross murdered his sister. Gross lies to Fay's parents, claiming he took her back to the Liberio Internment Zone. Fay's father tells Grisha their people's history and the Marley nation's justifiable prejudice towards them, accepting the officer's lie. In his adult years, Grisha joins the Eldian Restoration movement after learning the truth of Fay's death from an Eldian named Grice. The movement supported by the secret informant \"Owl\", Grisha learns the Eldians' true history while eventually marrying Dina Fritz, the last remaining Eldian with royal blood on the mainland, and they have a son, Zeke, who appears with them in a photograph. When Marley begins its Warrior program to keep up with rival nations over natural resources, Grisha's attempt to raise Zeke as an infiltrator backfires, as his son becomes loyal enough to turn the Restorationists over to the authorities, including his own parents. Grisha and his fellow Restorationists are then taken by boat to the perimeter wall of Paradis Island for exile as mindless Pure Titans once injected with Titan spinal fluid. Grisha recognizes Kruger and Gross among the squad as Gross kicks Grice off the wall and gives him a head start before turning the others into Titans, including Dina who becomes the Titan that will eventually devour Eren's mother. Gross admits killing Fay and was about to kick Grisha over the wall, only to be suddenly shoved by Kruger and eaten by a Titan. Kruger reveals himself to be both the Owl and a Titan shifter as he transforms into the Attack Titan and annihilates the rest of the Public Safety soldiers.",

        "description": "Armin transcribes Eren detailing Grisha learning the Owl's full name as Eren Kruger, the officer explaining how his desire to restore Eldia led to him participating in his people's persecution to maintain his cover. Kruger then reveals that those who possess the Titan Power live for only thirteen years, along with the two means of succession and the nature of the Coordinate, requesting Grisha to infiltrate Paradis and take the Founding Titan from the royal family. Kruger explains his reasons of selecting Grisha while advising him to start a new family before proceeding to inject him with the Titan serum, mentioning Armin and Mikasa to his own amazement. In the present, Eren and Mikasa are released from the stockade to participate in the conference among the government. Historia also attends after reading Ymir's farewell letter, glimpsing in her friend's memories as a result. With the evidence presented before the council, Hange expresses regret that their enemies now include other humans in addition to Titans while stating Eren could command the Pure Titans despite not being of the royal bloodline. It was then that Eren realizes that he commanded the Pure Titans because he touched Dina's Pure Titan form, keeping it to himself out of fear of what the military might do to Historia if he revealed this knowledge.",

        "description": "At the meeting of the Paradis government, Historia decides the people within the walls must be told the truth about the Titans which had been kept secret for 100 years and that the breaching of the wall by Titans was the beginning of a planned invasion by the state of Marley. This information is met with mixed reactions among the population. When Hitch approaches the survivors at a ceremony to honor their fallen comrades, Floch tells her what a hero Marlo was. He also raises the difficult question of why Armin was given the serum instead of Erwin, a controversial decision even among the survivors. As Historia presents the nine survivors with their medals, Eren touches her hand, and immediately he is flooded by memories of the Fritz royal family, indicating a connection through Titan blood. Within a year after the attack on Trost District, the Titans inside Wall Maria have been killed and the inhabitants return to their hometowns to begin rebuilding and farming. Six years after the fall of Wall Maria, the Survey Corps including the survivors again begin expeditions outside the wall. One day they find a Titan unable to move because of its small arms and legs and realize that they must be close to the perimeter wall where Eldians are turned into Titans by Marley. Riding further on, they finally arrive at the wall where Grisha became a Titan, and for the first time they see the shimmering ocean. They joyfully play in the water, though Eren realizes that they only found enemies across the sea instead of the freedom he has been seeking. He then points out into the distance and wonders if they kill all their enemies over there, would they finally be free.",

The operation to reclaim the Founding Titan was put on hold. Marley sends Eldian soldiers to take Fort Slava, including Warrior Candidates (candidates to inherit the Power of the Nine Titans) Falco Grice, his older brother Colt, Gabi Braun, Udo and Zofia. Colt proposes to Commander Theo Magath that they use the power of the Warrior Titans, but he refuses due to the Allied Forces' armored train possessing a deadly anti-Titan cannon. Gabi manages to approach the train and disable it with hand grenades. This allows Pieck's Cart Titan and Galliard's Jaw Titan to attack the fort. From an airship above Fort Slava, Eldians are transformed into Pure Titans by Zeke and are dropped onto it, destroying much of its structure. Reiner's Armored Titan, aided by the Jaw Titan, successfully pulverizes the fort's defenses, including another armored train. Zeke, noting that the cause of this war was their defeat, transforms into the Beast Titan and annihilates the Mid-East Allied Fleet, thus ending the four-year war. After witnessing the developed anti-Titan weaponry, Marley realizes their need to retrieve the Founding Titan.\n\nNote: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Funimation added a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode stating that the English dub voice actors were able to record their lines from the safety of their homes.

Willy tells the well-known story of Marley's hero Helos, who formed an alliance with the Tybur family to defeat the Eldian King Fritz. However, he reveals Fritz and the Tybur family fabricated the myth themselves since Fritz longed for peace. His ideology was passed through his bloodline, which kept his successors bound to his desire, while vowing to release the Wall Titans if the peace is shattered by Marley. Meanwhile, Pieck and Porco are sent down a trap door by a Marleyan soldier, which drops them into a small, stone-walled cellar, preventing them from transforming into Titans. On stage, Willy announces that an uprising has occurred on Paradis, and that the Founding Titan has been stolen by a man called Eren Jaeger. Willy explains that Eren is a threat to world peace as he is not bound by Fritz's vow to renounce war. In the basement, Eren apologizes to a horrified Falco and explains that since his arrival in Marley, he has realized that both Paradis and Marley are alike in that both sides are just people. He tells Reiner that the two of them are alike, but with contrasting beliefs due to their different upbringings. Reiner, devastated by the thought of everything that happened on Paradis four years prior, including the death of Eren's mother, is his fault, begs Eren to kill him. Just as Willy declares war on Paradis, Eren transforms into the Attack Titan, bursts out of the basement and crushes the stage along with Willy, throwing his mangled body into the air.",

Just as she prepares to kill him, Mikasa arrives and attacks the War Hammer's nape with Thunder Spears, but it turns out to be ineffective. Meanwhile, Udo is declared dead; a vengeful Gabi heads back to the battlefield, only to witness more death and destruction, infuriating her even more. Eren realizes that Lara's crystal-covered body is underground, connected by a long white cord. He transforms into the Attack Titan again and severs the cord, preparing to devour her. Porco's Jaw Titan leaps onto the Attack Titan's nape, but Levi arrives and slices its jaw-joint, much to Porco's surprise and horror as Levi initiates a counterattack against him.",

While Eren is distracted by the commotion, Lara partially re-materializes the War Hammer Titan, impaling and trapping the Attack Titan in a tree-like structure made of its hardened substance, but fails to pierce its nape. Zeke's Beast Titan arrives while Marleyan soldiers surround Liberio. Falco emerges from underground, protected by a bud-like shield formed by Reiner's partial transformation; he reunites with Magath and Gabi.

As the Survey Corps lose several soldiers, Armin arrives and transforms into the Colossal Titan, destroying the Marleyan Navy. Levi uses the distraction to disable the Beast Titan, dropping a grenade on the fallen Titan's nape. Sasha kills a machine gunner of the Panzer Unit, enabling Jean and other soldiers to destroy it and severely injure the Cart Titan using their Thunder Spears. As the Survey Corps try to kill Pieck, Magath and other Marleyan soldiers defend her. Meanwhile, Hange arrives overhead in an airship to recover the Survey Corps, guided by lights placed earlier in the battle. The Jaw Titan attacks the airship, but is dismembered and immobilized by Mikasa and Eren. The Attack Titan then uses its jaws like a nutcracker to shatter Lara's crystal and swallows her remains, gaining the powers of the War Hammer Titan. As Eren is about to eat Porco too, Gabi and Falco's frantic cries for help awaken Reiner, and he reluctantly emerges to confront Eren.",

Yelena and other Marleyan conscripted deserters who call themselves the \"Anti-Marleyan Volunteers\", offered help to the Eldians, backing Zeke Jaeger's plan to carry out the Rumbling in order to support them against Marley. Yelena and Onyankopon provided them with schematics of Marleyan guns and advanced weaponry. Using Yelena to lure in more scout ships while Armin's Colossal Titan takes some of them down, the Survey Corps recruited Marleyan soldiers as labor to build docks for the island.

Meanwhile, Levi shows Zeke the Forest of Giant Trees where they will be staying, and Commander Pyxis has the Volunteers detained in order to keep Zeke on a short leash. Armin reflects to the still-crystallized Annie on how whether helping Eren in the raid against Marley was the right decision.

A tattoo on Mikasa's arm revealed that she is the descendant of Hizuru's ruling shogun. Lady Azumabito believed that Hizuru could help Paradis achieve Zeke's plan on using the Rumbling to protect the island, in return for the valuable Iceburst Stone - the mysterious Paradis substance which powers ODM gear. She listed Zeke's propositions: to enact a test of the Rumbling, strengthen and modernize the Paradis military, and for the Beast Titan to be passed down to someone of royal blood who would bear children, so it could be passed on every 13 years. Historia agreed to inherit the Beast Titan, though Eren vehemently rejected the proposal. However, Hizuru's help rooted in greed, and a year later, they would not help Paradis negotiate trade with other nations. At that time, while working on the island's railway, the Survey Corps kept struggling with deciding their strategy against Marley and who should inherit Eren's Titan when his term runs out. In the present, Hange interrogates Eren for acting on his own against the military, resulting in Eren grabbing Hange and angrily asking her if she has any alternative plans. Historia is shown to be pregnant and living with a local farmer she knew from her childhood. Jean and Connie believe Eren has lost all sympathy for his friends.

He says it initially paralyzed them, then he turned them into Titans with his scream. Zeke claims he did it to maintain his cover, but Levi accuses him of not truly caring for the people he killed. During the Braus family\u2019s dinner, Kaya points Nicolo out to Gabi and Falco as the Marleyan who invited them, explaining that he was probably in love with Sasha. After the Survey Corps arrive in the restaurant to question him, Nicolo forcefully takes a bottle of Marleyan wine from Connie and Jean, telling them that it would be wasted on Eldians. He brings the wine to the cellar, to where Gabi and Falco follow him, revealing themselves as Candidates. Nicolo deduces that Gabi killed Sasha and attempts to bludgeon her with the bottle, but Falco takes the hit instead, and some of the wine gets in his mouth. Nicolo punches Gabi out then carries the two back to the dining room. He offers Mr. Braus a knife, saying either of them shall kill her. The Survey Corps intervenes, and through Mr. Braus, the emotions are seemingly calmed. Connie and Jean restrain Nicolo, but Mikasa has to save Gabi from Kaya who attempts to kill her. A devastated Gabi is escorted to another room by Mikasa and Armin, while Nicolo tells Hange to rinse Falco's mouth as he suspects that the wine Falco accidentally ingested is spiked with Zeke's spinal fluid. He explains that the wine came from Yelena's scout ship and was given to him by her to be served to the high government officials. Meanwhile, Levi receives word of Zachary's death and wonders if he completely miscalculated Eren's potential as humanity's savior. The Jaegerists raid the restaurant and hold everyone at gunpoint. Floch demands Zeke's location from Hange and reveals that he knew about Zeke's plan with the wine. Eren meets with Mikasa, Armin and Gabi and states that he wants to talk.",

Armin punches Eren in the face, but Eren beats him easily, mentioning he would never last in a fight. Together with the Jaegerists, they take Armin, Mikasa and Gabi to Shiganshina District where Eren plans to rejoin Zeke. In the forest, Levi plans to have Zeke eaten by a Jaegerist to prevent Eren from using the Founding Titan. However, Zeke runs from the camp and screams, which turns Levi's comrades into Pure Titans due to the spiked Marleyan wine they had drunk. Levi kills all the Titans and pursues Zeke, catching up with him. Zeke transforms into the Beast Titan in a desperate bid to escape, but Levi uses Thunder Spears to destroy the Beast Titan's nape and retrieves Zeke's damaged body. Floch turns the military cadets in Shiganshina to the Jaegerists' side by threatening them with imprisonment, forcing them to beat Keith Shadis. Zeke wakes up to find himself lying gravely injured in a cart, with Levi sitting beside him. He\u2019s told not to move and is informed by Levi that a Thunder Spear is impaled into his stomach, tied to a detonator around his neck. Levi starts chopping Zeke\u2019s legs; as Zeke falls unconscious in intense agony, he recalls a memory of his childhood.",

        "description": "As a child, Zeke was treated harshly by his parents, as Dina and Grisha saw him as a tool in their plans to restore Eldian society and overthrow Marley. One day, Zeke encountered Tom Xaver, the current holder of the Beast Titan, and over the years, they developed a close bond. When Zeke learned that his parents were Restorationists, he turned them over to the police at the urging of Xaver and to save himself from being turned into a Pure Titan. Xaver told Zeke that his research revealed that the Founding Titan is able to manipulate the body of Eldians. They resolved to \"save\" the Eldian people from further persecution through sterilizing them using the Founding Titan. Later, Xaver also revealed how to get around Karl Fritz's vow of renouncing war. Eventually, Zeke inherited the Beast Titan and promised to find a suitable person for their plan. Reuniting with Reiner and Bertholdt on Paradis, he learned that Eren Jaeger possessed the Founder. He deduced that Grisha Jaeger had managed to avoid getting turned into a Titan and vowed to rescue Eren from Grisha's brainwashing. In Liberio, Eren agreed to cooperate with Zeke's euthanization plan. As Zeke finishes reflecting on his past, his mumbling is heard by Levi. Zeke suddenly ignites the Thunder Spear impaled in his body, detonating it and catching Levi by surprise.",

Finally making their way to the principal's office, where they believe the cheeseburgers to be located, they find a gigantic key in the center of a small city. As the rest of the class fights to hold off the attacking Titans, Eren carries the key to the keyhole and unlocks it. Inside, they find themselves in what is revealed to be the principal's lunch box, as the Colossal Titan lifts the lid and takes the cheeseburger stand. Enraged, Eren attacks, but is swallowed along with the stand. As his classmates look on in horror, however, the Titan spits him back out, and Eren reveals that he managed to rescue one of the burgers. As the students celebrate their first victory against the Titans, Erwin tells the other faculty that with this victory, human students now have a chance for a happy school life.",
